 kessoku.1.d:0 "Due to insider information, Kita 'Kita' Ikuyo has fled to the Philippines to avoid imprisionment, either way, she won't be a problem anymore."
 kessoku.2.d:0 "Hidden deep into the Fuan Jungle, we found Ryou Yamada eating some weeds in a shack in the jungle to avoid being found, either way, she won't be a problem anymore."
 kessoku.3.d:0 "Nijika Ijichi has misterously dissapeared, as much as our forces have tried we couldn't find her anywhere, many rumors say that she returned back to heaven. Either way, I doubt that she will pose a threat to our government anymore."
 kessoku.4.d:0 "K-Kita-Chan was more polite than I thought... We reached to an agreement way too fast I think... But why would she accept? D-Didn't she dislike the Monarchy...?"
 kessoku.5.d:0 "Ryou is... Weird, b-but not in that meaning! I mean t-the good w-weird... You know? Hehe... But what an embarassment would be! I-I think I will get de-throned by my sister for making deals with this type of person t-then I'll go to jail then I'll get executed and then...!"
 kessoku.6.d:0 "Nijika accepted and told me about a "dream" she had... W-While she is very polite to me... Something feels w-wrong, but I'm scared to say it!\n I-I think it's just my stupid brain...Yes...Heh..."
 kessoku.7.d:0 "This morning we got a telegram from Kessoku, they are requesting us to withdraw from our Indochinese colonies and that we shall recognize them as the true owner of those lands, meanwhile this is complete chicannery, this could escalate to a major asian war."
 kessoku.8.d:0 "The french accepted our demands, they'll withdraw from the area and will give us the rights to use these lands as we please."
 kessoku.9.d:0 "The french refused our demands, saying that it was "complete Chicannery".\n meanwhile a war with france doesn't seem like our best interests, we got to show the world that we won't accept a no as a response."
 kessoku.10.d:0 "Today we got a hefty surprise when we saw Hitori 'Bocchi' Gotoh in one of our ports, the Kessokan Government told us that they extradited her a a few days ago and that they hope that we can do "Good use of her", we could show gratitude by this, or we could just accept it."
 kessoku.11.d:0 "The Japanese were pleased with the extradition, they in return gave us Palau, one of their islands on the Pacific."
 kessoku.12.d:0 "This morning one of the diplomats in Kessoku arrived to us with a, rather shocking ultimatum, we shall retire all forces from Wakaru and we shall give them total control over the state, they tell us that a failure to do so will result in war, what should we do?"
 kessoku.13.d:0 "The Siamese accepted! Luckily we can keep Wakaru'ing and not glitching all day!"
 kessoku.14.d:0 "The Siamese refused! they told us "We don't fear a nation that has such a stupid leader that she glitches all day", this totally means war!"
 kessoku.15.d:0 " "Th-The time that I spent playing with everyone in Kessoku Band was the most fun I had so...\n If it can be granted, then I want to play with everyone as a band again in my next life." "
 kessoku.16.d:0 "Hey! I'm not that apathetic! I know if I send you there you'll be the first ones dead, and god may not forgive, but I will!"
 kessoku.17.d:0 "Do what you gotta do."
 kessoku.18.d:0 "Fine! I guess I'll be your little ally, you scummy bassist.\n God please forgive me."
 kessoku.19.d:0 "Today in the National Palace for the first time since her coronation, Bocchi made a "Speech" to all the 30 thousand people that attended the speech.\n As she began to walk to the microphone, she only had 1 eye open meanwhile the other was closed. When she arrived at the Microphone she said "K-K-Kessokan People... I- Hitori Gotoh, wi-" before collapsing on stage, and only saying “noko” while on the ground.\n "
 kessoku.20.d:0 "Bocchi finally began to feel important, as she was wearing a luxury suit with a crown on her head, she began to think "M-My dream finally became true, I-I'm famous!"\n Meanwhile some people could call it "Forced courtesy", Bocchi loved the great amount of respect and kindness everyone had towards her in the meeting, and while she didn't talk much, she felt more relaxed even if it was in a relatively crowded space."
 kessoku.21.d:0 "Her first destination was none other than Siam, the country who has been illegally occupying the state of Wakaru since last year, she went there with the excuse of "Hoping to reach an agreement with the Siamese to return Wakaru".\n In reality, she wanted to test herself. The "meeting" went just as expected and both Bocchi and the Siamese delegate basically told each other to fuck off.\n The next step was French Indochina, the local delegate there still felt resentment over the Kessokan-French war but they appreciated Bocchi's stance.\n Although she heavily stuttered, she didn't faint or collapse (or explode) this time, so she calls it a success!"
 kessoku.22.d:0 "Bocchi was ready, the first time she had done this she had been humilliated internationally but not anymore. She was determined and strong to finally do the impossible task of... Doing a speech. Either way, she was ready.\n The crowd was gathered there, already expecting the 'Speech' to last no more than a few seconds.\n When Bocchi stood up and grabbed the Microphone, she began telling how, even if she wasn't Kessokan by birth, she was still a Kessokan by her mother, afterwards, she pulled out an Electric Guitar out of... nowhere? and started playing a song she made prior to this, called "Kessokan-Japanese"; expectedly the crowd was very surprised by this, but not in a bad way.\n After the song, Bocchi felt in the stars, Bocchi felt, as if she was a constellation, but that feeling was short-lived as inmediatily after ending the song she again collapsed, but it didn't matter, her task was done. Bocchi did it."
 kessoku.23.d:0 "Nijika recently has been having some thoughts in her head, thoughts that, as much as she tries to force them away, this ironically just makes them stronger. She has been feeling as if, her actions weren't very "angelical".\n Just now she has started to order the executions of people that could be a problem in the future for the new regime, at the same time doubting even her own best friends, with all these influx of events and decisions she has been making, she can't help but think to herself, "Am I really doing a good thing?"."
 kessoku.24.d:0 "We have won the Civil War!, we must now disarm all the militias we had until further notice."
 kessoku.25.d:0 "Ryou had arrived from the USA, she was wavering a piece of paper that said the confirmation of many US-Sponsored highways across the entirety of Kessoku.\n While many people were celebrating, others were skeptical of Ryou's ways of achieving this."
 kessoku.26.d:0 "Ryou had just sent me a telegram confirming the agreement for many American-Companies to start operations on Kessoku, that said the call was very short and only included the "must know".\n Who the hell knows what's happening on the other line."
 kessoku.27.d:0 "Ryou arrived to my office just screaming "We did it!", showing me a picture of the "Seishun", Asia's first nuclear reactor.\n Unlike the other times, Ryou told me that she was so proud of this that she wanted me to ask her how she did it, unfortunately to her desire, I didn't ask her anything."
 kessoku.28.d:0 "Today in the morning someone from Kessoku visited our country. They are requesting that we shall give them our colonies for "protection" against the uncoming Japanese menace, while it only seems as a greedy attempt at taking away our colonies, the girl stragely had an aura that did not let us think of anything other than to accept her demands..."
 kessoku.29.d:0 "The British accepted! I knew it!"
 kessoku.30.d:0 "Today in the morning someone from Kessoku visited our country. They are requesting that we shall give them our colonies for "protection" against the uncoming Japanese menace, while it only seems as a greedy attempt at taking away our colonies, the girl stragely had an aura that did not let us think of anything other than to accept her demands..."
 kessoku.31.d:0 "The Dutch accepted! I'm just that good am I?"
 kessoku.32.d:0 "We have won the Civil War!, we must now disarm all the militias we had until further notice.\n We must also know what we will do with the "Angel of Shimokitazawa" "
 kessoku.33.d:0 "They called me crazy, they called me a lunatic and "delusional", but here I am. Standing on Asia's first nuclear reactor.\n I had to go to a million different places, call a million different people, go to some place in the middle of the New Mexican Desert, but it all came out right. I'm just that good you know? But you already know that, otherwise you wouldn't be playing my path!"
 kessoku.34.d:0 "It was a crazy tour, but after sneaking back to the US, I could find many bussinessmen interested on Kessoku's highway system!\n They asked a bit too many questions but I managed to fool them just by telling to them that my name was "Roy Yamaha", I just need them to sign this piece of paper."
 kessoku.35.d:0 "Life tip for myself and whoever reads this, Chinese bussinessmen are the worst. Not only is their "communist" society very capitalistic but also that they're really, really scummy.\n Either way I could find someone who was crazy enough to invest into Kessoku, I just hope that they can let me keep the "Made in Kessoku" "
 kessoku.36.d:0 "We recieved a letter from Kessoku this morning, the letter says that their new administration is interested in the islands of Kuril. Meanwhile there is nothing that prevents us from refusing, neither it is preventing us from accepting it."
 kessoku.37.d:0 "Japan accepted! This is great news! Now we shall commence the great Kessokan invasion of the Russian far East!\n Yeah, I bet you didn't expect to hear that in your life."
 kessoku.38.d:0 "Japan refused? This is weird, this should never happen. The game?"
 kessoku.39.d:0 "We recieved a letter from Kessoku this morning, the letter says that their new administration is interested in the island of Iwo Jima. Meanwhile there is nothing that prevents us from refusing, neither it is preventing us from accepting it."
 kessoku.40.d:0 "Japan accepted! This is great news. Now I shall prepare for the great Kessokan invasion of the Americas.\n Yeah, I bet you didn't expect to hear that in your life."
 kessoku.41.d:0 "Kessoku Band collapsed! It's all ryover..."
 kessoku.42.d:0 "Today, we recieved a letter from a certain person with the nickname of "Dorito", with no real name attached to the letter, it said:\n "I am not crazy! I know she swapped those files! One before me. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. She - she covered his tracks, she got that idiot at the palace to lie for her.\n You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? She's done worse. That assasination! Are you telling me that a man just happens to get killed like that? No! She orchestrated it! Ryou! She's a drug dealer! And I saved her! And I shouldn't have. I took her into my own church! What was I thinking? She'll never change. She'll never change! Ever since she was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep her hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Ryou! Couldn't be precious Ryou! Stealing them blind! And she gets to be an advisor!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped her when I had the chance! And you - you have to stop her..."\n The letter briefly stops, almost as a sudden realization just happened in the author's head. Nevertheless, they decided to send the letter still."
 kessoku.43.d:0 "On the recently-made Congress, Nijika Ijichi made a speech about her "friend", Ryou Yamada, halfway through it it seemed as if she completely lost it, and quoting her:\n "I am not crazy! I know she swapped those files! One before me. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. She - she covered his tracks, she got that idiot at the palace to lie for her.\n You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? She's done worse. That assasination! Are you telling me that a man just happens to get killed like that? No! She orchestrated it! Ryou! She's a drug dealer! And I saved her! And I shouldn't have. I took her into my own church! What was I thinking? She'll never change. She'll never change! Ever since she was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep her hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Ryou! Couldn't be precious Ryou! Stealing them blind! And she gets to be an advisor!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped her when I had the chance! And you - you have to stop her..."\n She suddenly stopped. She saw as how the entire congress was looking at her with thousand yards stares, she knew she made a mistake and just retired from the building."
 kessoku.44.d:0 "Many files from anonymous sources claim that recently hired Ryou Yamada has not only connections with the Kessokan Organized crime, but is a vital part of it!\n I didn't expect her to end this way... I don't know what to say!"
 kessoku.45.d:0 "Many files from anonymous sources claim that recently hired Ryou Yamada has not only connections with the Kessokan Organized crime, but is a vital part of it!\n And the worst part of it? I already know."
 kessoku.46.d:0 "Many files from anonymous sources claim that recently hired Ryou Yamada has not only connections with the Kessokan Organized crime, but is a vital part of it!\n I- I don't... Understand very well..."
 kessoku.56.d:0 "Ryou Yamada, leader of "Free Kessoku" has recently sent us an interesting proposal, to join the allies in exchange of Lands.\n While everyone laughed at it, for some reason we still accepted it..."
 kessoku.57.d:0 "A Mexican band called "Queso Cubano" Has recently catched up to Ryou's story and made a song called "La Weeder", the song being the first of it's kind, it quickly called the name of "Narcocorrido"\n Although Ryou did like the song, it's unfortunate that she can't understand anything of it."
 kessoku.58.d:0 "Why is leading a nation so hard! I knew it would be complicated, but not this much! If there just was someone else who could help me through these hard times..."
 kessoku.59.d:0 "Many people dare to critize my way of leading this god-blessed Empire! They just don't know how hard it is for a singular person to lead millions of people!\n But I don't care enough! A good angel must not be influenced by others."
 kessoku.60.d:0 "Welcome to Bocchi at War!

 kessoku.61.d:0 "Can I resign?! Where?!\n I- I don't feel capable, I need an adult, I need an adult! no... I need my guitar! ANYTHING!\n But if I resign... My sister will take over the throne and she will get killed and I will get killed and my parents will have to run away and they'll be homeless an- Agh I hate my brain!"
 kessoku.62.d:0 "Please god, make it stop.\n How hasn't she changed a bit?! It's ridiculous! It's been decades and she's still the same! What's this chic- Okay, relax Nijika. Just... Just handle it."
 kessoku.63.d:0 "What's wrong with her? This is it. This has broke me. I am completely in shock and can't believe that Nijika could do such thing, I really didn't think she could do something of this magnitude... I'm just in Shock. Wow.\n Why did she refuse to lend me the chocolate bar she was eating?"
 kessoku.64.d:0 " "Oh do you wanna know why don't I let you findle my church? You remember when I did let you and can you please tell me what happened?"\n "I- I dressed as a priest in order to move drugs without being checked." "
 kessoku.65.d:0 "I was on a family dinner, everything was going great. The food was great. Until someone which wasn't even of my family told me "Ikuyo, do you want more?" IKUYO!? I. Always. Told. Them that my name was KITA KITA.\n How can they do this to me? I am defeated. I don't have power for anything. My name is Kita Kita.\n Kita Kita.\n Kita Kita."
 kessoku.66.d:0 "I have usually been pretty lucky, since the day I was born in fact, being of a wealthy family myself.\n Or how I met Nijika even, I was just alone when she came to me, I guess you can call her my salvation because I don't know where would I be without her.\n but most importantly, I am lucky of being so good. Where would I do without my skils? Maybe I would be starving to death... or being rich on my family's house."
 kessoku.67.d:0 "The pope? That's a no one! I am the true messenger of God, I am the Paragon of Human Virtue without any equal past or present!\n But why am I comparing myself to my fellow Brothers?! I don't know... Sorry!"
 kessoku.68.d:0 "Where would I be without my guitar?! I- I'm not sure... But that doesn't matter anymore! It really doesn't... I t-think. I have it and she's my best friend...\n I know it sounds goofy for an inanimate object to be my best friend but... I-It is what it is!! I love it!! I am normal I swear!! Please believe me..."
 kessoku.69.d:0 "Heyaaaaa! I didn't wanna miss this would I?! Of course not!! Hi mom I'm on someone's monitor can you beleive it?!!?!?! I surely can! Hey can you lend me some moneY?! my paypal is [REDACTED] I will award you with an exclusive punch to the stomach!!"
 kessoku.70.d:0 "Seika is usually quite strict on her own men, like when she allegedly almost killed a man for telling her that he wanted her to "dominate him" but no trustable sources confirm this incident.\n having gained the nickname of "The Manager" after her past of being a manager of a club called "Starry" on Shimokitazawa. While many people expect her to be religious considering her little sister, in reality she in her own words "doesn't care too much" about religion and just focuses on her own duties."
 kessoku.71.d:0 "Kessoku is a country in ruin. Formed by Japanese settlers after leaving Japan due to the formation of the Tokugawa Shogunate after 1603, southern Indochina was consolidated and the kingdom remained relatively stable.\n That was until the French invasion of Indochina in 1858, starting with a joint Franco-Spanish attack on Saigon. Afterwards and over the years, Kessoku kept crumbling, and everyone thought Kessoku would be yet another nation to fall to colonialism and imperialism.\n Except it didn’t. Everything changed during the Franco-Prussian war in 1870. Britain started sending weapons and support to Kessoku for god knows why, and with the fall of the Second Empire and soldiers being needed in France, Kessoku managed to push out the invaders with major victories.\n This drew the attention of the newly formed German Empire, who used this opportunity to humiliate the French even further. Included in the Treaty of Frankfurt, Kessoku was to remain independent in southern Indochina, with the French allowed to do what they themselves desire in the rest of Indochina."
 kessoku.72.d:0 "Now that leads us to today. The monarch was just recently assassinated by an unknown person with Blue RGB hair, and the country has begun to fall into chaos.\n While an assassination and an outdated military are already bad enough, what’s worse is that the monarch didn’t have any heir. Therefore, the country had to bring in the person who is the closest blood-wise, Hitori Gotou from The Empire of Japan.\n To be blunt, the people hate her. She was also born with extreme social anxiety, which makes her a powerless leader in leading the country and through conducting diplomacy. Due to this, the state of Wakaru ended up being invaded and illegally occupied by Siam next door. There is also another major issue with the country, and that it is split into three other factions:\n One of them being The Church of Nijika led by Nijika Ijichi, a Kessokan native born to Taiping Revolutionaries who fled to Kessoku after the fall of the Taiping Rebellion during the Qing Dynasty.\n Another is a Democratic coalition under Ikuyo Kita, who for whatever reason prefers herself called “Kita Kita” and is also rumored to have feelings for the current monarch.\n Finally, the last group is a Weed eating cult led by Ryo Yamada. However, Ryo’s hair looks similar to the one that assassinated the previous monarch however, which is quite strange.\n Anyways, if you couldn’t tell already, the country is on fire. Many think the country is doomed and will collapse soon, from a foreign power such as Japan, who has been militarizing heavily the past few years. However, the future hasn’t happened yet, and depending on what Hitori Gotou or another faction does, this country could see a massive boom economically, politically, and militarily."
 kessoku.73.d:0 "Hey, you!\n Are you enjoying the mod? I hope so! Ignore the fact that I am sentient, I am just PA-San being PA-San. Time to go back with Seika, goodbye!"
 kessoku.74.d:0 "A common rumour on Kessoku is that Hitori Gotoh, current monarch of Kessoku, is "Not human."\n While this is obviously not true at first glance, many people have catched on many "anomalies" that distinct her from a normal person, like:\n Her ability to turn into liquid just to solidify like nothing.\n How she explodes and then comes back like nothing.\n A ton of weird things that she does that solidify this small theory, with the enough budget and now that we're researching rockets... We could find the true answer to all of this!"
 kessoku.75.d:0 "The truth has been unfolded. Hitori Gotoh is...\n An anime character.\n And what's that you might ask? Well worry not! We discovered that Hitori Gotoh has many unexplicable powers, which can only be explained through the power of the "plot", a special power which for those on their favor, could give them any kind of power with no explanation needed.\n Needless to say, this discovery will bring prestige to our great nation!"
 kessoku.76.d:0 "Nijika Ijichi has been found on the Border Customs of Kessoku!\n She tried to flee to Siam but fortunately they managed to stop her. Now we have to know what we should do with her."
 kessoku.77.d:0 "Usually my sister is the one who has supported me the most, she's the one who tells me what things are good and bad... But lately she has been doing the opposite, she has been telling me that "This isn't how I educated you" and that I am "far from an Angel nowadays"\n I really don't know why... It feels like whatever I do nowadays she complains about it. Maybe it's my fault... No! I-I understand her... I think."
 kessoku.78.d:0 "Many people have told me that I seem a little underweight... How so?! Does it make me look bad?! I-I need to be careful of my body otherwise I could lose all my career! I-I have thought about losing weight because of... Something but it's just thoughts! Stupid thougts! I-I would never do such thing... Right?!"
 kessoku.79.d:0 "I was walking on the street today when I saw something familiar, it was a girl with red hair. Upon closer inspection I realized it was Kita 'Kita' Ikuyo, one of the people who rose up against Kessoku on the Civil War and my old friend.\n Although it may surprise you, I have no hard feelings for her even after what happened, in contrary I liked her bravery on rising up against the government. We had a little chat where she told me that the loss of someone who "was very important to her" affected her a lot and meanwhile she never told me the name, I have an idea who could it be.\n She seems to be doing well so I wish her the best, and I also wish that she would have brung money. As she had none to lend me for food."
 kessoku.80.d:0 "Futari... She's evil! I-I don't care what anyone says!!\n D-Don't get me wrong I love her as my sister of course... B-But she only does things which are only compared to the D-Devil himself... W-Why didn't she stay in Japan?! D-Did she really want to come over with me...? Hehehe... Maybe she isn't as bad! Yeah! She's perfect!!"

 kessoku.82.d:0 "Recently, a film has gone viral all over the country, this film is named "My name is Nijika Ijichi", the tape says something like this:\n "My name is Nijika "Dorito" Ijichi. I live at Shimokitazawa, GSA, Kessoku. This is my confession. If you're watching this film, I'm probably dead– murdered by my partner-in-crime, Ryou Yamada.\n Ryou has been building a criminal empire for well over half a decade, and while I despised this side of her, I still considered myself a friend of her. It wasn't until recently that she came to me with a rather, shocking proposition.\n She asked me to use my charisma and my followers to rise up against the government. I was... astounded, I... While Ryou didn't have morals as her number one priority, overthrowing an entire country and asking ME to help her? But you know what's the worst thing? I accepted it. I am just as faulty on this.\n When we won the civil war, she told me that we would have a "prosperous" future together, but not less than 35 days she told all her followers to go against mine in what seems to be a "hit" on me. A part of me knew that was gonna happen, it's the same Ryou I have known since decades after all but I was still shocked.\n Now we go towards the present, my church is destroyed and my hope and goal in life is as well. I don't know where I'll be or where I'll go but definitely not on Kessoku and not with the name of "Nijika Ijichi"\n The reason I do this tape? Is to let others know, do not trust this girl." "
